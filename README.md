# deepseek-ocr.rs üöÄ

Rust implementation of the DeepSeek-OCR inference stack with a fast CLI and an OpenAI-compatible HTTP server. The workspace packages the vision-language model, prompt tooling, and serving layer so you can build document understanding pipelines that run locally on CPU, Apple Metal, or NVIDIA CUDA GPUs.

## Inside `crates/core` üî¨
- **Vision preprocessing** ‚Äì `prepare_vision_input_from_image` builds a square global canvas with letterboxing (`build_global_view`) and, when crop mode is enabled, applies `dynamic_preprocess` tiling to produce high-resolution local crops plus optional thumbnails.
- **SAM + CLIP fusion** ‚Äì each view is normalised via `image_to_tensor`, pushed through the Candle ports of SAM (`SamBackbone`) and CLIP-L (`ClipVisionModel`), then flattened with `build_clip_sam_tokens` so the features stay spatially aligned.
- **Projector & layout tokens** ‚Äì the custom `ImageProjector` linearly maps concatenated SAM/CLIP channels into the language hidden size while injecting learned `image_newline`/`view_separator` tokens to preserve grid structure, yielding the multimodal embeddings used during decoding.
- **Tokenizer alignment** ‚Äì `build_prompt_tokens` synthesises `<image>` spans whose length exactly matches the projected token count (global + local grids), ensuring OpenAI-style prompts remain consistent even after chat history pruning.
- **Decoder & caching** ‚Äì the text stack is a Candle reimplementation of DeepSeek-V2 (`DeepseekLanguageModel`) with optional FlashAttention, rotary position embeddings, and `DynamicCache` guards so both the CLI and server can stream tokens efficiently.
- **Observability & parity** ‚Äì debug builds expose CLIP/SAM traces (`VisionDebugFeatures`) so we can diff intermediate tensors against the PyTorch reference; most stages are already numerically aligned, and the few remaining deltas (mainly projector normalisation + vision tiling) are tracked on the roadmap for upcoming releases.

## Why Rust? üí°
The original DeepSeek-OCR ships as a Python + Transformers stack‚Äîpowerful, but hefty to deploy and awkward to embed. Rewriting the pipeline in Rust gives us:
- Smaller deployable artifacts with zero Python runtime or conda baggage.
- Memory-safe, thread-friendly infrastructure that blends into native Rust backends.
- Unified tooling (CLI + server) running on Candle + Rocket without the Python GIL overhead.
- Drop-in compatibility with OpenAI-style clients while tuned for single-turn OCR prompts.

## Technical Stack ‚öôÔ∏è
- **Candle** for tensor compute, with Metal and CUDA backends and FlashAttention support.
- **Rocket** + async streaming for OpenAI-compatible `/v1/responses` and `/v1/chat/completions`.
- **tokenizers** (Hugging Face) wrapped by `crates/assets` for deterministic caching.
- **Pure Rust vision/prompt pipeline** shared by CLI and server to avoid duplicated logic.

## Advantages over the Python Release ü•∑
- Faster cold-start on Apple Silicon, lower RSS, and native binary distribution.
- Deterministic Hugging Face asset download + verification built into the workspace.
- Automatic single-turn chat compaction so OCR outputs stay stable even when clients send history.
- Ready-to-use OpenAI compatibility for tools like Open WebUI without adapters.

## Highlights ‚ú®
- **One repo, two entrypoints** ‚Äì a batteries-included CLI for batch jobs and a Rocket-based server that speaks `/v1/responses` and `/v1/chat/completions`.
- **Works out of the box** ‚Äì pulls model weights, configs, and tokenizer from Hugging Face on first run.
- **Optimised for Apple Silicon** ‚Äì optional Metal backend with FP16 execution for real-time OCR on laptops.
- **CUDA-ready** ‚Äì build with `--features cuda` and run with `--device cuda --dtype f16` to leverage NVIDIA GPUs on Linux/Windows.
- **OpenAI client compatibility** ‚Äì drop-in replacement for popular SDKs; the server automatically collapses chat history to the latest user turn for OCR-friendly prompts.

## Quick Start üèÅ

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.78+ (edition 2024 support)
- Git
- Optional: Apple Silicon running macOS 13+ for Metal acceleration
- Optional: CUDA 12.2+ toolkit + driver for NVIDIA GPU acceleration on Linux/Windows
- (Recommended) Hugging Face account with `HF_TOKEN` when pulling from the `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR` repo

### Clone the Workspace
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TimmyOVO/deepseek-ocr.rs.git
cd deepseek-ocr.rs
cargo fetch
```

### Model Assets
The first invocation of the CLI or server downloads the config, tokenizer, and `model-00001-of-000001.safetensors` (~6.3GB) into `DeepSeek-OCR/`. To prefetch manually:
```bash
cargo run -p deepseek-ocr-cli -- --help # triggers asset download
```
Set `HF_HOME` or `HF_TOKEN` if you store Hugging Face caches elsewhere. The full model package is ~6.3GB on disk and typically requires ~13GB of RAM headroom during inference (model + activations).

## Command-Line Interface üñ•Ô∏è
Build and run directly from the workspace:
```bash
cargo run -p deepseek-ocr-cli -- \
  --prompt "<image>\n<|grounding|>Convert this receipt to markdown." \
  --image assets/sample_1.png \
  --device cpu --max-new-tokens 512
```

> Baseline parity assets under `baselines/sample/` are gitignored; use the bundled `assets/sample_1.png` or supply your own image path if you haven‚Äôt generated the baseline set locally.

> macOS tip: append `--features metal` to the `cargo run`/`cargo build` commands to compile with Accelerate + Metal backends.
>
> CUDA tip (Linux/Windows): append `--features cuda` and run with `--device cuda --dtype f16` to target NVIDIA GPUs.

Install the CLI as a binary:
```bash
cargo install --path crates/cli
deepseek-ocr-cli --help
```

Key flags:
- `--prompt` / `--prompt-file`: text with `<image>` slots
- `--image`: path(s) matching `<image>` placeholders
- `--device` and `--dtype`: choose `metal` + `f16` on Apple Silicon or `cuda` + `f16` on NVIDIA GPUs
- `--max-new-tokens`: decoding budget

## HTTP Server ‚òÅÔ∏è
Launch an OpenAI-compatible endpoint:
```bash
cargo run -p deepseek-ocr-server -- \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 \
  --device cpu --max-new-tokens 512
```
> macOS tip: add `--features metal` to the `cargo run -p deepseek-ocr-server` command when you want the server binary to link against Accelerate + Metal (and pair it with `--device metal` at runtime).
>
> CUDA tip: add `--features cuda` and start the server with `--device cuda --dtype f16` to offload inference to NVIDIA GPUs.

Notes:
- Use `data:` URLs or remote `http(s)` links; local paths are rejected.
- The server collapses multi-turn chat inputs to the latest user message to keep prompts OCR-friendly.
- Works out of the box with tools such as [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) or any OpenAI-compatible client‚Äîjust point the base URL to your server (`http://localhost:8000/v1`) and select the `deepseek-ocr` model.
- Adjust the request body limit with Rocket config if you routinely send large images.

## GPU Acceleration ‚ö°
- **Metal (macOS 13+ Apple Silicon)** ‚Äì pass `--device metal --dtype f16` and build binaries with `--features metal` so Candle links against Accelerate + Metal.
- **CUDA (Linux/Windows, NVIDIA GPUs)** ‚Äì install CUDA 12.2+ toolkits, build with `--features cuda`, and launch the CLI/server with `--device cuda --dtype f16`.
- For either backend, prefer release builds (e.g. `cargo build --release -p deepseek-ocr-cli --features metal|cuda`) to maximise throughput.
- Combine GPU runs with `--max-new-tokens` and crop tuning flags to balance latency vs. quality.

## Repository Layout üóÇÔ∏è
- `crates/core` ‚Äì shared inference pipeline, model loaders, conversation templates.
- `crates/cli` ‚Äì command-line frontend (`deepseek-ocr-cli`).
- `crates/server` ‚Äì Rocket server exposing OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
- `crates/assets` ‚Äì asset management (configuration, tokenizer, Hugging Face download helpers).
- `baselines/` ‚Äì reference inputs and outputs for regression testing.

## Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è
- **Weights download fails** ‚Äì export `HF_TOKEN=<your-token>` and retry. Assets land in `~/.cache/huggingface` by default.
- **Slow first response** ‚Äì model load and GPU warm-up (Metal/CUDA) happen on the initial request; later runs are faster.
- **Large image rejection** ‚Äì increase Rocket JSON limits in `crates/server/src/main.rs` or downscale the input.

## Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è
- ‚úÖ Apple Metal backend with FP16 support and CLI/server parity on macOS.
- ‚úÖ NVIDIA CUDA backend (build with `--features cuda`, run with `--device cuda --dtype f16`) for GPU acceleration on Linux/Windows.
- üîÑ **Parity polish** ‚Äì finish projector normalisation + crop tiling alignment; extend intermediate-tensor diff suite beyond the current sample baseline.
- üîÑ **Grounding & streaming** ‚Äì port the Python post-processing helpers (box extraction, markdown polish) and refine SSE streaming ergonomics.
- üîÑ **Cross-platform acceleration** ‚Äì continue tuning CUDA kernels, add automatic device detection across CPU/Metal/CUDA, and publish opt-in GPU benchmarks.
- üîÑ **Packaging & Ops** ‚Äì ship binary releases with deterministic asset checksums, richer logging/metrics, and Helm/docker references for server deploys.
- üîú **Structured outputs** ‚Äì optional JSON schema tools for downstream automation once parity gaps close.
